# NEWS

## First Public source released!
[25/04/2018] Dubbed version 0.05.00.180425, all current source scripts have been pushed to this hub. Documentation is currently limited to what I've commented into the scripts, and no ESP file has been comitted (although compiled scripts are currently present, just to show that the source is in working order). A Notepad++ Language file is provided on the main page, which highlights all current script types, variables thereof and all Function definitions. It also includes some missing vanilla syntax. 

Please be patient while work continues on both a working test file and official documentation.
